# Session 9: Loops

## Loops (10 min)

- show for-loops
- discuss that the loop counter is a special variable

## Compiler game (10 min)

- go through a program line-by-line together
- kids need to "act as a compiler", i.e., explain what the code does

## Practical exercise (70 min)

- animate LED matrix: slowly fill a single row
- fill entire matrix (nester for loops)
- come up with a custom animation
